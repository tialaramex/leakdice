leakdice is a tool which dumps random pages from a specified process

Dependencies:

Linux 2.x with proc filesystem

Concept:

The idea behind leakdice is that a Monte Carlo sampling method is effective
for diagnosing gross leaks. Unlike more conventional leak-detecting methods
the sampling method doesn't require the process to be instrumented, instead
it relies on the following chain of ideas:

* The program's normal working set is much smaller than the leaked data

* Therefore a randomly selected page of heap data is much more likely to
contain leaked data than other (not leaked) data

* Low-level programmers most likely to be diagnosing a leak are familiar
enough with the data structures used in their code that there's a good chance
they can identify them by sight


Usage:

For example, if your leaking process has PID 5844, simply type:

leakdice 5844

If the page dumped seems irrelevant, try again, a different random page
should be chosen.
